                              This part shows the analysis based on the number of the worldâ€™s young population who are out of school 
                              across primary- and secondary-school-age based on their gender. Apparently, there are slightly more male who 
                              got out of school compared to female.However, as the world is advancing, we could see the change of student that 
                              dropped out of school. There are less people who do not received education in this current years than those in 1990s. 
                              It is interesting to see the changes on how education are developed 
                              and delivered around the world over the years,to make sure that more and more people receive education.

                              Similarly, in average years of schooling, there seems to be less discrimination for genders over the years. B
                              oth genders are now receiving the same education 
                              in this current era, which could not be expected in the 1980s - 1990s. Currently, Asia and Africa is a 
                              little bit behind the other developed continents in education equality.But there has been an absolute changes 
                              in terms of gender education for everyone. Hopefully, in the future, the gender ratio is revert into a line and 
                              such everyone will receive equal education.

                          Education in each country is highly impacted by the government's policies and also their expenditure.
                          Thus, it is crucial to analyze the government expenditure in proportion of their GDP. Most of the countries spend
                          no more than around 7% of their GDP into their education sector, in which more than 5% is considered as very high.
                          Countries such as <b>Finland, Denmark, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden have consistently spent over 5%</b> of 
                          their GDP into their education sector. This aligns with their education quality level that is recognized as 
                          some of the best over the world. 
                          <br>
                          <br>
                          On the other hand, <b>developing countries like Armenia, Gambia, Georgia, Madagascar, and 
                            Philipines spent around 3-4% of their GDP for their education</b>. However, there does not seem to be a significant
                          correlation between each countries expenditure and their education quality. This is because countries such as Singapore
                          spend less than 5% but they are regarded as a one of the top country with the best education system producing 
                          great educated people.

                          The <b>Program for International Student Assessment (PISA)</b> is an international assessment that 
                          measures 15-year-old students' reading, mathematics, and science literacy every 3 years.
                          <b>China reached the champion with the highest PISA score, followed by Singapore and Finland</b>. Meanwhile, the top 8 lowest PISA
                          score are occupied by developing countries.

                          Overall, the school completion rate for each degree is pretty high. <b>Most of the continents reached a near complete
                          100% for each level of education</b>. Africa is the only continent with lower than 80% of completion rate. 
                          The variation in education completion rates across different continents is influenced by a complex interplay of 
                          historical, socio-economic, cultural, and political factors.

                          <b>Africa experiences lower education completion rates</b> due to a multitude of challenges. Conflicts, 
                          health crises, and political instability also disrupt learning, causing dropouts and incomplete education. Additionally, 
                          cultural factors sometimes prioritize early workforce participation over education.

                          <b>Asia often exhibits relatively good education outcomes</b>, driven by several factors. Governments invest heavily in 
                          education infrastructure and teacher training. Additionally, Asia's rapid economic growth has allowed for increased 
                          investment in education. Interestingly, Asia has a higher completion rate for secondary level than the primary level.

                          <b> North and South America can exhibit similar education completion rates </b>when individual countries within these continents 
                          prioritize education, invest in infrastructure, and create equitable access to quality education, thereby bridging the gaps that may exist 
                          due to regional or continental divisions.

                          <b>Europe is frequently seen as having some of the best education systems globally</b>. Several factors contribute to this 
                          reputation. Europe has mandatory schools, research institutions, comprehensive welfare systems. Thus, Europe completion rate for
                          each education level is always above 90%.

                          <b>Oceania's lower completion rate for lower secondary compared to higher secondary education </b>is often due to students 
                          facing increased academic and logistical challenges in the early stages of education. Higher secondary education may 
                          attract more committed students, leading to higher completion rates.

                  In 1820, the literacy rate was only as low as 12.05%. The latest data in 2021 shows the literacy worldwide has increased steeply to a percentage of 83.51.
                  Thanks to advancement of technology, compulsory education, and ease to access of education via digital devices!
                  The global trend suggests that literacy will continue to increase, driven by ongoing efforts to improve education, greater access to information through digital technology, 
                  and a growing awareness of the importance of literacy for personal and societal development.
